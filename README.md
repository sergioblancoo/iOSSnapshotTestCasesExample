Snapshot view unit tests for iOS - Examples :v:
## Getting started
Install dependencies with
```
pod install
```
First time you run the Tests you will need to change:
```
self.recordMode = true
```
in order to record the Reference Images. After that you can change it back to
```
self.recordMode = false
```
to run the comparison.
